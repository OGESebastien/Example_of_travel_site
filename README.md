# README - Epitech Project

This project is an example of a HTML and CSS website for a fictional airline called "Epitech Air." The website provides information about the company, its popular destinations in Asia, an "About" section, and a contact form.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **HTML Files**: HTML files are used to structure the content of the web page. The main sections of the site are defined within `<section>` tags, and content is structured using appropriate HTML tags.

- **CSS Files**: The "style.css" file is used to define the layout and visual presentation of the website. It is linked to the HTML files using the `<link>` tag.

- **Images and Videos**: The site uses images and a video to illustrate destinations and content.
